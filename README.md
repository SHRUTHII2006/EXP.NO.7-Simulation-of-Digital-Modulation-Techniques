# SOFTWARE REQUIRED

Python Software 

-> Numpy Library 

-> Matplotlib Library 

-> Scipy Library (for signal processing)

# ALGORITHMS


1.Define binary data sequence

2.Set bit duration and sampling rate

3.Generate time vector based on total bits and sampling rate

4.Create carrier signal

      ASK/PSK: single frequency

      FSK: two frequencies (for '0' and '1')

5.ASK: Multiply carrier with binary data

6.FSK: Switch between two carriers based on binary data

7.PSK: Apply phase shift (Ï€) for bit '0'

8.Plot original message and modulated signals (ASK, FSK, PSK)

# RESULT / CONCLUSIONS

The digital modulation techniques ASK, FSK, and PSK were successfully simulated using Python.


The simulation demonstrated how ASK, FSK, and PSK modulate a carrier signal to transmit binary data. Each modulation technique has its own method of altering the carrier wave, which is essential in digital communication systems.
